          </div>
          <div class="post-body">
            <p>Working on ThemeRoller was a lot of fun and it taught me a lot about client-side styling and user interfaces in general.
It has also stood out in my mind as I continue to interact with more and more CSS frameworks, and I keep longing for more
tools like ThemeRoller.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line with ThemeRoller, someone asked me, &quot;Why is this tool specific to one framework?
Couldn&#39;t you create a tool that would work with any CSS file?&quot;. My immediate reaction was that this
person clearly didn&#39;t understand the complexity of the problem (turns out, it&#39;s not that complex at all).</p>

<p>But the thing is, even after wrapping up my involvement with jQuery Mobile, that person&#39;s question was still echoing in
the back of my mind. Would it be that hard to develop some framework-agnostic, WYSIWYG theme creation tool?</p>

<p>My immediate thought was to improve upon current developer tools. We all know Firebug and Chrome&#39;s developer tools work 
just fine for debugging and quick styling, but I think the app I have in mind would do more for non-developers
beginning to dabble in some frameworks like jQuery Mobile or Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I could potentially put a little time and effort into forking/extending a tool like Firebug and adding some nice color
pickers and number spinners, but at the end of the day it wouldn&#39;t reach as many people or be all that usable.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s my thought. I want to create an extensible and configurable theming application that any developer can
grab, tweak, and apply for his specific framework. This way, each framework could potentially have it&#39;s own
customized version of the tool, but at the end of the day the basic ingredients are all the same.</p>

<p>What are those ingredients? Glad you asked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fast, light-weight parsing of any CSS file</li>
<li>UI elements specialized towards various CSS rules</li>
<li>Colorpicker</li>
<li>An inspector tool for point and click edits</li>
<li>Draggable colors with customizable behaviors</li>
<li>Undo/Redo Logs of every action the user makes</li>
<li>Downloadable/Shareable themes</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as parsing goes, for now I&#39;m thinking that the API will mostly handle the business logic of the actual skinning.
But the rules that a user has access to will need to be specified by the developer. This can be done with some esoteric CSS
comment for every rule that needs to be represented in the UI. Or, more likely, some specific JSON that the developer could write
out quickly that would list which rules are editable, and how they are grouped.</p>

<p>The potential for this app extends beyond just the big-name frameworks. The tool could also be used when designing a site
for a client. I&#39;ll give you a scenario. You whip up a site design, and your client is unhappy with your choice of typeface,
color, spacing, etc, but he likes the overall layout. Why bother iterating on color choices? Design a solid layout, and then let
the clients skin the page themselves. All you do is provide a base theme that can be easily tweaked. Sounds nice right? </p>

<p>Ok, so there&#39;s the overall outline. I&#39;d love to get some feedback on the idea, as well as any questions/suggestions you
might have about implementing this thing. Give me a shout-out on
<a href="http://twitter.com/tybenz">Twitter</a>,
<a href="mailto:tabenziger@gmail.com">email</a> me or submit a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/themebot/themebot">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Note: This project is nothing more than a thought for now, so no, there&#39;s no source code to look at. Check back later for
updates. It will be soon.</p>

      <article class="post">

                <h1><a href="/post/patterns">Patterns</a></h1>
          </div>
          <div class="post-body">
            <p>For my first post, I&#39;d like to talk a little about patterns.</p>

<p>Most programmers are puzzle solvers. We sit and tinker all day trying to solve interesting
problems, or most often, solving problems we&#39;ve created ourselves. The most rewarding part of this puzzle solving,
is when a pattern is identified, and an association is made. Simplifying these patterns into reusable pieces of code
is what makes programming fun. I know I&#39;m most proud of code that I&#39;ve written that is highly reusable. </p>

<p>What typically happens is that programmers will put off writing truly reusable code until absolutely necessary. I do,
and so does everyone else. I&#39;ve outlined a little bit of what typical puzzle solving looks like (at least for me):</p>

<ol>
<li>Button Mashing

<ul>
<li>I start prototyping a solution to a problem</li>
<li>I throw good coding practices out the window and just try to get results on the screen</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Refactoring

<ul>
<li>I spend hours and hours tweaking code to be more readable/efficient/reusable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Epiphany

<ul>
<li>I realize some subset of my new code is similar to something I&#39;ve written before</li>
<li>I create some small utility/API that is tailor-made for a certain coding pattern</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Quickly, I&#39;ll say that the big time-suck in Step 2 can be reduced if better code is written from the start.
Understandably, outside factors can make this impractical (e.g. time constraints, rapid prototyping, etc).
I&#39;d still recommend finding the balance between an accurate, fast prototype, and a clean implementation as much as possible.</p>

<p>Now, where does the pattern come in? What I&#39;d really like to focus on is Step 3. This Epiphany is usually what spawns excellent
libaries/widgets/gems/APIs. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s walk through a more concrete example.</p>

<p>Recently, I was messing around with Ruby on Rails and I had started added some client-side/server-side communication
via AJAX. I&#39;ll take you through a smaller, similar app and see if you can spot the pattern.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s design a Grocery List application. The user can create Lists which contain multiple Items.
We&#39;ll have a unalterable, finite set of possible items the user might want on a list.
If we wanted to create a page where the list can be built out on the client-side and then pushed to the server to save the list,
we&#39;d need a way of querying for items, as well as some button to submit the completed list.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="c">&lt;!-- Submit this form with the name of the item to get back data from server --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;get-items&quot;</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">&quot;/items&quot;</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">&quot;get&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-remote=</span><span class="s">&quot;true&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;items[name]&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;submit&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;table</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;grocery-list&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;tbody&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>1.<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>First Item<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
        <span class="c">&lt;!-- Add new row here with the new item --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/tbody&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And some more:</p>

        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice the pattern? It&#39;s actually something that is quite common in web apps. When submitting data/requests via AJAX,
there is always some sort of follow-up action performed on the client side, typically appending some new set of markup
somewhere to display response data.</p>

<p>So I decided to create a generic way to respond to these AJAX calls. By leveraging a templating tool like
<a href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache.js</a>, or 
<a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">underscore</a>, it was easy to write a utility to listen
for AJAX responses, and append a template, populated with the response data.
I found this tool incredibly useful, and I&#39;m still working on making it
more universal to the task. It&#39;s called AjaxAppend and you can read more
about it <a href="/projects/ajaxappend">here</a>.</p>

<p>You see that with a simple example like one above, pointing out these patterns in your mind can save you, and potentially others,
a lot of time in the long run (provided you take the time to do something about it).
Now when I need this type of AJAX/JSON/Markup workflow in an app, I write a few lines of JS, and I&#39;m done.</p>

<p>So there it is.</p>

<p>Bad Code -&gt; Pattern -&gt; Simplify Problem -&gt; Widget/Plugin/Function/API/etc</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve outlined here, is a workflow for putting together reusable utilities. While it may seem slow and imperfect,
the truth is there aren&#39;t a lot of other options. Most programmers don&#39;t have the gift of foresight, so for now, this retroactive
simplification of repetitive code will have to do. Make sure you keep your eyes peeled for patterns that can be taken advantage of,
and tweet/message me some patterns you&#39;ve identified and what you did about it.</p>
